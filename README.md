# Getting Started with Living with Spina Bifida (LWSB)

Living With Spina Bifida (LWSB) is a social media support group for people with Spina Bifida. The purpose of this application is to provide users with a centralised platform where they can discuss their condition and get support through other people or resources.

## Running the code

To get started, install Node then run this code in the terminal:

```javascript
npm i axios bcrypt body-parser concurrently cors express mysql2 nodemon react react-bootstrap react-dom react-router-dom react-script
```

This will install all the required packages to run the application.

```javascript
npm run dev
```

Run this command to start the application, which will load it in the browser. This runs the app in the development mode. Using nodemon and concurrency, the app simultaneously runs React and Node.\
