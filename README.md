# Getting Started with Living with Spina Bifida (LWSB)

Living With Spina Bifida (LWSB) is a social media support group for people with Spina Bifida. The purpose of this application is to provide users with a centralised platform where they can discuss their condition and get support through other people or resources.

## Running the code: node and npm
Assuming Node and NPM are installed on your machine:

1. Download the code
2. Navigate inside the project folder on terminal, where you will see a package.json file
3. Do an npm install for installing all the project dependencies
4. Do an npm install -g nodemon for installing all the project dependencies

This will install all the required packages to run the application.

```javascript
npm run dev
```

Run this command to start the application, which will load it in the browser. This runs the app in the development mode. Using nodemon and concurrency, the app simultaneously runs React and Node.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
